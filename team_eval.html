		<h1>1 General</h1>
			<p>This is a short team analysis of the team <i>Skeletor 2016</i>, lead by <i>John Woo</i>. The active team roster consisted of:</p>

			<p>The team went 8:8 during the regular season and lost its first play-off matches 0:2. I joined the team after my team (captained by Boelens) broke apart after week 2.</p>
			<p>The other 2 people that were technically still on the team after Panda left (whom I replaced) were:</p>
			<table>

						<th>Name</th>

			</table>
			<p>While I never met Mozak, <i>in search of hapiness</i> was on the team Discord channel regularly, watched our official matches (and was ready to replace team-mates in case of emergency) and very occasionally practiced with us. (when I was around) From the very limited contact I had with him, I can say that he's an agreeable and nice guy. Unfortunately I can't really judge any game-related aspects of him.</p>
			<p>Everything that follows has to be taken with a grain of salt considering that my 4305 MMR might not allow me to judge every aspect of the team correctly on account of not being qualified enough.</p>

		<h1>2 Explanation of terms</h1>
			Apart from the captain, whom I review in greater detail (due to higher responsibilities), I generally describe each team member in 5 different categories:
			<ul>
				<li>A <b>general</b> section, that contains everything not clearly attributable into the other 4 categories,</li>
				<li>an <b>out-of-game mentality</b> section, which describes how the people interacted &amp; behaved outside of the game,</li>
				<li>an <b>in-game mentality</b> section, which describes their directly game-affecting behaviour in matches,</li>
				<li>a <b>preparation</b> section, which describes what kind of preparation the individual did for matches,</li>
				<li>and a <b>performance</b> section, which describes their in-game performance in detail. The <i>stability</i> point in this section makes a reference to the standard deviation &sigma;, which I estimate to be about 400 MMR. (Loosely based on the MMR distribution <a href="http://blog.dota2.com/2013/12/matchmaking/">Valve published in 2013</a>) That means that if it says "&lt; 2&sigma;", I estimate that player's performance to fluctate by about 800 MMR. The estimation is a purely subjective impression, there is no data behind it.</li>
			</ul>
		<hr>
		<h1>3 Team evaluation</h1>
			This section covers player-specific reviews, mostly in a pro/contra format.
			<h2>3.1 Everybody</h2>
				<p>Items listed in this section apply to all active team members. They will not be repeated for each individual player below.</p>
				<p>As for the positive aspects, I can say that every member of the team</p>
				<ul class="procon_lst">
					<li class="itm_pro">was very dependable. Nobody dropped games unannounced. Everybody was available for almost every match.</li>
					<li class="itm_pro">was highly active. Everybody played a lot of matches and practiced a lot.</li>
					<li class="itm_pro">was highly communicative. People chatted and spoke almost every day of the week.</li>
					<li class="itm_pro">was motivated during practice, i.e. they trolled games very rarely.</li>
					<li class="itm_pro">was motivated to do post-match discussions on at least some of the matches.</li>
					<li class="itm_pro">was proficient in spoken/written english.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There weren't really any obvious negative traits everybody on the team shared. Apart from myself, all players were first-timers this season. The inexperience showed a bit, but wasn't majorly impactful.</p>

			<h2>3.2 John Woo</h2>
				<h3>General</h3>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Availability: Available often during peak times (6pm - 10pm)</li>
						<li class="itm_ntr">Memebility: Satisfactory</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Out-of-game mentality</h3>
					<p>He basically has 2 modes he operates in: let's call it a pre-tilt and a post-tilt mode. In pre-tilt mode, he's a demanding but fair individual, who has no problem delivering directed, succint criticism to other people as well as accepting criticism. He discusses problems pre- and post-match a lot and brings up problems when he sees them. His focus is on winning matches, while still allowing for (british) humor.</p>
					<p>In post-filt mode, which to my observating is triggered by losses, underperformance of team-mates or himself, his demeanor drastically changes and negatively affects team-mates. He stops trying to find causes for underperformance and argues each instance of it, adopts a derogatory tone &amp; stops modulating his behaviour depending on whom he's talking to. (Basically he becomes a small ulafzs. No offense intended.) In that mode, even partly justified criticism understandably falls on deaf ears and the team loses the motivation to communicate with him in general.</p>
					<p>While potentially applicable in the military, RD2L does not seem like an appropriate environment for this behaviour. He could be one of the better captains in this league if he fixes the cause of these behaviourial oddities.</p>
				<h3>In-game mentality</h3>
					<p>He directed well, communicated clearly and brought everything down to the point in pre-tilt mode.</p>
					<p>He however is also easily frustrated. Even before post-tilt mode he sometimes complained points that are better left for a discussion after the game. These complaints emanate a chilling effect that effectively disrupts further team communication. Again, if he fixed that, he could easily be one of the better directors of this league.</p>
				<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>He not only watched replays of his team-mates &amp; that of enemy teams, but also prepared drafts adjusted to our opponents. He scouted dotabuff profiles and built drafts around the abilities of his team. All in all, a very active caption who puts in the effort.</p>
				<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p>As for his general performance:</p>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Stability: Stable player, had occasional slumps (&lt; 1&sigma; = 400 MMR)</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Hero versatility: Wide hero pool, however this did not get applied in official matches</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Role versatility: Wide; has displayed to be proficient in 1, 2 &amp; 4 position</li>
						<li class="itm_ntr">Aggressiveness: Aggressive</li>
					</ul>
					<p>He played a very effective 4p, which routinely farmed better than the off-lane (me), basically transforming him into a 3p. Even though according to his own opinion his strengths lie in the strategic &amp; tactical side of DotA, he's a far better technical player than I am, so I can't really judge any further.</p>
					<p></p>
				<h3>Captaining</h3>
					<p>Generally he did all the right things that I think a captain should do (apart from 2 issues): often interacted with the team, scouted properly, strategized, made sure we always had enough players available &amp; delegated tasks properly. It shows that he has experience captaining teams outside of RD2L.</p>
					<p>The 2 issues I identified were:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Our team did not scrim, he did not organize any. We only pubbed. This made us lack the necessary reflection to identify our weaknesses properly. Not only that, but we also didn't practice a lot of different configurations, to an extent where we saw ourselves playing an entirely unpracticed line-up in an official match. (first-time heroes)</li>
						<li>His post-tilt behaviour destroyed a lot of the effort that he put in in the first place.</li>
					</ol>
				<h3>Drafting</h3>
					<p>I consider drafting to be my weakest skill when it comes to DotA, so read the following with extra care.</p>
					<p>His basic strategy was: dominate lanes, overwhelm the enemy early and deathball them. This made the team very successful in the first half of the season. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> half, teams had us figured out and we went on a losing streak. In general this meant we only played a very limited set of configurations. We also didn't practice anything outside of that, so we didn't grow comfortable with anything else.</p>
					<p>Had we practiced more diverse line-ups and strategies, we might have been able to be less prone to out-drafts. To me this looks to be a result that this is his first season in RD2L.</p>

			<h2>3.3 nagnogg</h2>
				<h3>General</h3>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_con">Availability: A bit short on time sometimes</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Memebility: Good</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Out-of-game mentality</h3>
					<p>He displayed a great team mentality and was always motivated during practice. He had no problem handling criticism maturely and wasn't afraid to voice his opinion when he thought he was correct. He has a keen sense of how to deliver criticism to various people in a correct and analytic manner. He flaunts a very sociable and agreeable personality and targets balance and harmony instead of confrontation (a perfect counter-point if you have more socially aggressive players on your team). In this team, he played the role of the devil's advocate when it came to strategizing and acted like a counter-point to a very aggressive captain.</p>
					<p>For the good feed-back he provided, unfortunately I feel like it wasn't frequent enough, especially considering he had the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest MMR and was most qualified to do so. It felt to me as if he required an enabler to be more active in improving the performance of team members through criticism.</p>
				<h3>In-game mentality</h3>
					<p>He was always very concentrated / focused. He never tilted even once and was a figurative <i>rock of the team</i>. Sometimes took the torch and made calls.</p>
					<p>However he was also very quiet at times, being outvoiced by stronger personalities on the team. That limited his capability to bring in more calls, which would have absolutely been warranted considering he had the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest MMR on the team.</p>
				<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>He helped scouting opponents: mainly movement patterns &amp; ward spots (from replays) as well as favorite / most successful heroes (from Dotabuff).</p>
				<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p>As for his general performance:</p>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Stability: Very stable player (&lt; 0.5&sigma; = 200 MMR)</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Hero versatility: Wide hero pool</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Role versatility: Wide; has displayed to be proficient in 1, 2 &amp; 4 position</li>
						<li class="itm_ntr">Aggressiveness: Balanced, very slightly passive</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I don't really think I can judge him much. It is apparent he's a much better and more stable player than I am and displayed he understands the game flow. In my opinion the best player on the team when it comes to technique.</p>

			<h2>3.4 Booty Lizard</h2>
				<h3>General</h3>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Availability: Available often during peak times (6pm - 10pm)</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Memebility: Very Good</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Out-of-game mentality</h3>
					<p>Apart from being motivated during practice, he was a mentality booster / catalyst. Whenever people were a bit lazy, he could motivate them to play. A very underrated trait.</p>
					<p>Just as with nagnogg, I wished he would have provided criticism more often and participated more actively in discussions. He also has a bit of a problem handling socially confrontational captains (think ulafzs), but it didn't seem to translate into the game. He can also be a bit judgemental, though he doesn't display it openly.</p>
				<h3>In-game mentality</h3>
					<p>His catalyzing mentality translated into the game as well: whenever games weren't going very well, he could motivate people to continue giving their best.</p>
				<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>He helped a bit with Dotabuff scouting immediately before the match.</p>
				<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p>As for his general performance:</p>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Stability: Relatively stable player, had occasional slumps (&lt; 1&sigma; = 400 MMR)</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Hero versatility: Wide hero pool</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Role versatility: Wide; has displayed to be proficient in 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5 position</li>
						<li class="itm_ntr">Aggressiveness: Passive</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Apart from being a better player than I, he seems risk-seeking, farming in potentially riskier places, being punishable. This works out if the enemy does not have enough momentum to punish it, however seems not worth it if the enemy team can actually abuse it. So his default farming patterns / behaviour fit well into super-aggressive line-ups.</p>
			<hr class="player_bar">
			<a id="player_Molten_Knight" />
			<h2>3.5 Molten Knight</h2>
				<h3>General</h3>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_pro">Availability: Available often during peak times (6pm - 10pm)</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Memebility: Excellent</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Out-of-game mentality</h3>
					<p>Just as Booty Lizard, he was a huge mentality booster, always motivating people to play, due to being a naturally all-around well-spirited human being.</p>
					<p>Being the lowest MMR player on the active, regular roster, of course he was target of a majority of the criticism. While being open to criticism in general, he has a slight problem handling larger quantities of criticism, especially when it is expressed derogatorily.</p>
				<h3>In-game mentality</h3>
					<p>Just as being well-spirited out-of-game, it translates really well into the game, being able to motivate people in games that don't go that well. He has no problems following instructions and occasionally makes calls when he feels it's absolutely necessary. (Mostly about retreats)</p>
					<p>However, he also seems to have a threshold of complexity after which he has a harder time following calls / instructions, which can generate some friction. Sometimes he also over-saturates the voice-chat with useless banter.</p>
				<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>He helped a bit with Dotabuff scouting immediately before the match.</p>
				<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p>As for his general performance:</p>
					<ul class="procon_lst">
						<li class="itm_con">Stability: Highly erratic performance (&lt; 2&sigma; = 800 MMR)</li>
						<li class="itm_con">Hero versatility: Limited hero pool</li>
						<li class="itm_pro">Role versatility: Wide; has displayed to be able to play 1, 4 &amp; 5 position, however on a limited hero pool</li>
						<li class="itm_ntr">Aggressiveness: Balanced</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Plays well on a few select support heroes. His in-fight performance out-classes his strategic / tactical performance by far. (think SirActionSlacks)</p>
					<p>He played support 5 position in our team but seemed much more comfortable in core roles. He has a few glaring issues in the support role: ward spots were usually sub-optimal and movements were inefficient. He has issues multi-tasking (the <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Mental_Checklist">mental check-list</a>), including focusing on map awareness and gameflow. This makes it necessary to micro him to some extend.</p>

			<h2>3.6 WaruiKagemusha</h2>
				<p>It's hard to judge yourself. All I can say is that I seem to have communicational issues, not always clearly explaining my thoughts. That is an issue as the off-lane player, especially when playing initiators or when I adjust my build and the captain only finds out 10 minutes later that we're missing an essential tool because of that. My hero pool also lacks a bit and profits from extension.</p>
